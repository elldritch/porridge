There's a user on [Imgur] named [onlyporridge]. True to their name, this user
only ever posts images of porridge. Sometimes, these images of porridge make it
to the front page. This project is an exploration of why.

Goals:

1. Predict whether a submission of porridge is worthy of the front page.
2. Predict the popularity (score) of a submission of porridge.
3. Generate porridge submissions that are likely to make front page.
