There's a user on [Imgur] named [onlyporridge]. onlyporridge, true to their
name, only ever posts images of porridge. Sometimes, these images of porridge
make front page. This project is an exploration of why.

The main goal is to predict whether an image or porridge is front-page-worthy.
The stretch goal is to generate front-page-worthy porridge submissions.
